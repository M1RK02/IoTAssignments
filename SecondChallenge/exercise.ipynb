We assumed the temperature value changes every 5 minutes or that we could program it to do so, and also that given the ideal connection we could use non confirmable messages without worrying.\n",

    "EQ2-1) At first we tought of lowering message sizes. Using MQTT-SN it is true that we have to add a step in the beginning, the registration phase, but all publish messages will be smaller. We got the messages dimensions for Reg and RegAck from the last exercise seen in class (all the other sizes corresponded so we think it's a good estimate) and removed 8 byte (10 byte previous topic - 2 byte for the topicID) from the publish messages, we know it's not exactly like this but it's to give an estimate. We also tought of reducing the payload size since 8 bytes are too much for a temperature value, 4 bytes are sufficient."
